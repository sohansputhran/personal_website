* Volunteered and led a team of AI Enthusiasts to collaborate and work on Rooftop and Obstacle Detection Task.
* Created a custom dataset by annotating the obstacles on the rooftop.
* Built an Obstacle detection model using [YOLACT](https://github.com/dbolya/yolact) instance segmentation model.
* Built multiple Rooftop detection models and compared them using ML metrics.
