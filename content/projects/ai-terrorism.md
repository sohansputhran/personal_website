* Won the “Financial Crime Data Challenge” organized by the UN.
* Volunteered with a global team of AI engineers, the UN Office of Counter Terrorism and goFintel project, to build and deploy models to identify and prevent financing of terrorism.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on different datasets for easier understanding of data.
* Combined multiple datasets and cumulated the findings through different types of graphs.
* Built a web application using Streamlit to deploy all the models and displayed results of all the data analysis.
